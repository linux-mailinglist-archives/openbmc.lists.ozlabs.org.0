Hi Rahul,

I'm not aware of any current work on MCTP-over-I3C for OpenBMC or in-kernel.
It could be added as another in-kernel MCTP transport alongside the current
I2C net driver.

I'm not sure what the current status is for I3C drivers on BMC hardware.
Kernel I3C will only support Linux as an I3C Controller not Target, though
that would suit many setups.

Cheers,
Matt
