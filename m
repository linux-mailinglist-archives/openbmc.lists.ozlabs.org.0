Hi Nancy

In the past IBM has made NUMA systems with multiple chassis that are =20
stitched together into a single SMP fabric.  In these systems each chassi=
s =20
has one or more BMCs.

If a =E2=80=9CRedfish Aggregator=E2=80=9D would aggregate the Redfish sta=
cks on each BMC in =20
a system like this, then that sounds like an effort that IBM would =20
potentially find useful and want to contribute to.

thx!  -brad
