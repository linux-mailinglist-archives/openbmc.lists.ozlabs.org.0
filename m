There's a Version Purpose of "System"[1] that "is an aggregate for the 
system as a whole." IBM is planning to use this to bundle the BMC and 
host firmware in a single file, which as Vernon mentions would ensure 
that one is compatible with the other.

Not saying the proposed PSU design has to include the 'combined image' 
details, we can just have a mentioning that it can be an option and we 
can re-discuss how a bmc+PSU could look like once I send some details on 
the bmc+host image in the next few months.
