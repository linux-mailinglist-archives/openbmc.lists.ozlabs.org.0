Hi All,

  I was starting to explore on the design for the operator panel seen on 
IBM systems, it is also called a control panel , which basically is a 
card unit which has an LCD and some buttons to navigate the display on 
the LCD. I wanted to check if there is any design or code out there, for 
such  kind of usage. The design/code can be checked to see if it can be 
made generic for use, even though the hardware is only used by IBM.


Thanks a lot

Jinu Joy
