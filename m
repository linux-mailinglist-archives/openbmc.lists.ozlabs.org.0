spi-nor, FWIW.

Yeah, this actually grew out of some OpenBMC bringup work on another 
ASRock board -- I started out with a 100MHz clock since that's what I'd 
been using without a hitch on previous ASRock systems (such as these), 
but saw sporadic data corruption.  Some discussion on the OpenBMC 
Discord 
(https://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/775694683589574659/1074904879023263774 
and 
https://discord.com/channels/775381525260664832/775694683589574659/1075336116212875335) 
prompted me to try 50MHz instead, which seemed to solve the problem -- 
then after enquiring about it with ASRock I discovered that the 100MHz 
clocks we've been using on these boards are also officially out of spec.
