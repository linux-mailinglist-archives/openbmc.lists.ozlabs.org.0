Sorry for the late replay as I have been out of the office.

In my testing on this type of failure, I found that there is a race 
condition between the Chassis and BMC losing power after the blackout. 
If the Chassis loses power while the BMC is still active, it can 
sometimes detect it, change the Chassis State to Off, and persist it 
before losing power.  When this happens, the next boot will see only the 
Off state persisted and not detect the blackout.

To work around this, we have added a delay when persisting the Chassis 
State.  In a normal Off, it will be persisted after the delay; in a 
blackout off, the delay will prevent the BMC from persisting the Off 
state allowing the blackout to be detected.
