Tao, in your new patch will it be possible to disable the setting of the 
BMC MAC?Â  I would like to be able to send NCSI_OEM_GET_MAC perhaps with 
netlink (TBD) to get the system address without it affecting the BMC 
address.

I was about to send patches to add support for the Intel adapters when I 
saw this thread.

Thanks,

Terry
