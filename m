I'm not an expert, but it seems like you would create a bbappend (maybe 
in the raspberry pi layer?) for 
https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-phosphor/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-host_git.bb
This append would undo the effect of: RDEPENDS_${PN} += 
"virtual/obmc-watchdog"
In this way, the phosphor-ipmi-host package would not pull in the 
watchdog package.

But you probably just need to remove phosphor-ipmi-host and 
phosphor-watchdog (via virtual/obmc-watchdog) will no longer be pulled 
into the image.

To remove phosphor-ipmi-host you would do something like: DEPENDS -= 
"phosphor-ipmi-host".

I hope someone who knows will tell us how to really do it!

I want the webui server power widget to power on/off using these services, but I think the watchdog is interfering. My understanding is obmc-chassis-poweron/off will trigger host-poweron/off.
