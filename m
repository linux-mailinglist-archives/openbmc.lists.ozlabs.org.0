Not so much for now, little too busy on april.

This is whitelist/blacklist part. Any security-relevant event should be in
whitelist. Or we talking about some 'security list'?

This is post-process in 'User actions'.

I assume it is possible with additional list for such events. This list will not
be configurable and always on with their configuration. Also, what about
generation of these logs from BMC admin? If so, then we need to care about some
trust on transaction level for such events.

Any ideas where it can be stored?

Thanks.
