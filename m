Nice!02 Thank you for referencing that (I missed that review).02 It seems 
to me that phosphor-defaults.inc should02 set the root user password only 
when IMAGE_FEATURES includes allow-root-login, and otherwise not allow 
login.02 My bitbake is weak, but something like this:

# Set the root password to '0penBmc' if IMAGE_FEATURES contains 
allow-root-login,
# otherwise use "!" so root cannot login.
EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS_pn-obmc-phosphor-image = " \
usermod -p \
${@bb.utils.contains("IMAGE_FEATURES", 'allow-root-login', "", "!", d}\
'\$1\$UGMqyqdG\$FZiylVFmRRfl9Z0Ue8G7e/' root; \
"
(except use correct bitbake syntax).


BTW, we ought to update the [password hash algorithm][], currently 
$1$=MD5 to $5$=SHA-256 or $6$=SHA-512.
[password hash algorithm]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passwd

That sounds right to me.02 I think various OpenBMC users have these use 
cases:

Use case 1: remove root access by default

We share the use case of removing root access by default which we can do 
by removing 'allow-root-login' from IMAGE_FEATURES.

I would like to see the OpenBMC project should move toward this as the 
default.02 That bring me to use case 2...


Use case 2: have a way to re-enable root access

We also need a way to re-enable root access to the BMC's shell. I 
suggest we design a phosphor D-Bus API as the common way to enable and 
disable root login access.

I see divergent use cases for root shell access.02 OpenBMC developers 
will continue to need root login (for example, SSH to the BMC using 
default root credentials) on a regular basis.02 They will also need that 
access when they are called upon to debug systems currently running a 
workload.

However, users with sensitive data on their host system will want to 
lock out the root user, all SSH access, and especially root SSH access 
because of the additional capabilities root has compared with regular 
Administrator users and because of the difficulty in monitoring and 
auditing shell commands.02 Specifically, I think root login access and 
SSH access must both be addressed.02 In my opinion, if we give any users 
SSH access to the BMC shell, it is too easy for them to escalate that 
privilege to root, so we should have a way to lock out SSH access.

The solution you presented is an IPMI OEM command. Another idea is a 
Phosphor REST or Redfish API to control these items (root login and SSH 
server capability), and limit that to the BMC Administrator role.02 Those 
APIs would use the D-Bus API as the underlying implementation.

I think OpenBMC needs an easy way to re-enable root access before we can 
remove root access.


Use case 3: create an admin user by default

A related topic is the use cases for the "genesis experience", that is, 
the first time a BMC admin uses their newly-installed BMC.02 The options 
include:
A. The BMC has no default users.02 When needed, they are created via 
unauthenticated host access.
B. The BMC has no default users.02 An Administrator account is created by 
the initial user to access the system.02 This would make OpenBMC behave 
like other operating systems (such as Ubuntu) and devices.
C. The BMC has a user with username=admin and role=Administrator and a 
default password.02 This is close to what OpenBMC has now and what I 
would propose for the project default.02 (Naturally, we would add 
'no-admin-user' to IMAGE_FEATURES for use cases that do not want this user.)

The options above all assume the current genesis & provisioning 
experience.02 It would be possible to provision the BMC with its firmware 
image, custom user access credentials, an IP address, etc., before 
powering on the BMC for the first time.02 I would like to explore the 
possibilities in that space, but the remainder of this note assumes the 
traditional genesis experience described in the options above.

In any case, the admin user will have a way to gain root login access 
for themselves and to lock out root access by non-admin users.

I think OpenBMC needs to document how to access and provision the BMC, 
including details such as how to login as root and how to lock out root 
access.

___

As usual, I've written too much.02 I would be happy to hear your ideas, 
review your solution, and help where I can.

TL;DR: More ramblings for the use cases above: Have a way for a BMC 
Administrator to gain root access to the BMC shell.

What is the use case to allow a non-root user to use the BMC shell (via 
SSH or other access)?02 What will that let them do?02 I think you need to 
have sudo access for commands like journalctl and systemctl, or to 
invoke D-Bus APIs.02 I mean I think what you can do with the BMC's shell 
is extremely limited without sudo access.02 Are we thinking we should set 
up sudo?

If we have sudo access (so I can, for example: `ssh admin1@${bmc_ip} 
sudo`) then why would I need to login as root.02 Would root login be 
needed?02 I think we can do without root logins, but we would need to get 
sudo working...and havde a way to control when sudo is enabled. (In 
other words, I don't have good idea how to handle this.)

Note: Per the [phosphor user management group roles][], should the 
[access via SSH][] be changed to the "ssh" group?02 It is currently 
restricted to the priv-admin group.
