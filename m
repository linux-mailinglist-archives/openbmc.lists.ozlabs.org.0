I did not mean to ignore, i have few reasons listed below that provides

> Explain what is eSPI.
eSPI is a serial bus interface for client and server platforms that is 
based on SPI,Â  using the same master and slave topology but operates 
with a different protocol to meet new requirements. For instance, eSPI 
uses I/O, or input/output, communication, instead of MOSI/MISO used in 
SPI. It also includes a transaction layer on top of the SPI protocol, 
defining packets such as command and response packets that allow both 
the master and slave to initiate alert and reset signals. eSPI supports 
communication between Embedded Controller (EC), Baseboard Management 
Controller (BMC), Super-I/O (SIO) and Port-80 debug cards. I could add 
this to the commit message as well in the next patchset.

eSPI uses Peripheral, Virtual Wire, Out of Band, and Flash Access 
channels to communicate different sets of data.

  * The *Peripheral* Channel is used for communication between eSPI host
    bridge located on the master side and eSPI endpoints located on the
    slave side. LPC Host and LPC Peripherals are an example of eSPI host
    bridge and eSPI endpoints respectively.
  * *Virtual Wire* Channel: The Virtual Wire channel is used to
    communicate the state of sideband pins or GPIO tunneled through eSPI
    as in-band messages. Serial IRQ interrupts are communicated through
    this channel as in-band messages.
  * *OOB* Channel: The SMBus packets are tunneled through eSPI as
    Out-Of-Band (OOB) messages. The whole SMBus packet is embedded
    inside the eSPI OOB message as data.
  * *Flash Access* Channel: The Flash Access channel provides a path
    allowing the flash components to be shared run-time between chipset
    and the eSPI slaves that require flash accesses such as EC (Embedded
    Controller) and BMC.

Although , eSPI reuses the timing and electrical specification of Serial 
Peripheral Interface (SPI) but it runs an entirely different protocol to 
meet a set of different requirements. Which is why i felt probably 
placing this in soc was a better choice rather than spi. Do you think 
otherwise ?

Apologies, this was not my intention. I wanted this to be as generic as 
possible. But i don't really have much knowledge on what's the right way 
to model things in kernel at the moment. Still trying to learn and 
understand by looking at various other drivers. Appreciate all the 
feedback.

sure , will fix that. Is there a link that could help me understand 
various styling requirements on the DTS files. Also is there any 
formatting tool available currently ? that could fix the styling in the 
DTS files automatically rather than manual inspection/modification. Did 
i accidentally missed running some tool check ?

Krzysztof,Thanks for the review comments. I am still figuring out few of the 
review comments (would need a little more time, since its my first 
attempt into kernel development) , but mean while I wanted to make sure 
if the direction of choosing "soc" vs "spi" was correct, so that i could 
re-work on the comments.So i have selectively answered to few of your 
comments. Could you let me know if the reasoning that was provided in 
reply to your comments help ? Thanks, Manoj

That's not syscon. Why do you have ranges then? Where is any explanation
of hardware which would justify such combination?

That explains nothing. Unless you wanted to use here MTD bindings.

This binding did not improve much. I don't understand why this is not
SPI (nothing in commit msg, nothing in description), what is eSPI,</pre>

    <p><font size="2">eSPI uses Peripheral, Virtual Wire, Out of Band,
        and Flash Access channels to communicate different sets of data.</font></p>
    <ul>
      <li><font size="2">The <strong>Peripheral</strong> Channel is
          used for communication between eSPI host bridge located on the
          master side and eSPI endpoints located on the slave side. LPC
          Host and LPC Peripherals are an example of eSPI host bridge
          and eSPI endpoints respectively.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2"><strong>Virtual Wire</strong> Channel: The
          Virtual Wire channel is used to communicate the state of
          sideband pins or GPIO tunneled through eSPI as in-band
          messages. Serial IRQ interrupts are communicated through this
          channel as in-band messages.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2"><strong>OOB</strong> Channel: The SMBus packets
          are tunneled through eSPI as Out-Of-Band (OOB) messages. The
          whole SMBus packet is embedded inside the eSPI OOB message as
          data.</font></li>
      <li><font size="2"><strong>Flash Access</strong> Channel: The
          Flash Access channel provides a path allowing the flash
          components to be shared run-time between chipset and the eSPI
          slaves that require flash accesses such as EC (Embedded
          Controller) and BMC.</font></li>
    </ul>
    <p><font size="2">Although , eSPI reuses the timing and electrical
        specification of Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) but it runs
        an entirely different protocol to meet a set of different
        requirements. Which is why i felt probably placing this in soc
        was a better choice rather than spi. Do you think otherwise ?</font><br>

I am still figuring out few of the review comments (would need a little more time, since its my first attempt into kernel development) , but mean while I wanted to make sure if the direction of choosing "soc" vs "spi" was correct, so that i could re-work on the comments.So i have selectively answered to few of your comments. Could you let me know if the reasoning that was provided in reply to your comments help ? 

Thanks,
