Hi Vijay,

Yes, I saw you submitted a change on ipmb kernel driver to make it.
Thanks a lot for your effort. Differently from mqueue slave driver, ipmb
driver uses ipmb packets instead of raw data stream so the ipmbbridge
service could be simplified if we use ipmb driver. I don't think we need
to support both mqueue and ipmb drivers in the service so it would be
good if we can replace the logic with ipmb driver support in ipmbbridge
service.

Thanks,
Jae
