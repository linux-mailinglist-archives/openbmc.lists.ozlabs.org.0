Hi Everyone

I will no longer be hosting the OpenBMC community call that happens on
Mondays.

The agenda has been very light for quite some time now.  And weekly
phone calls aren't really a part of the the open source/distributed
collaboration model anyway.

I encourage you to bring your OpenBMC discussion and work to the
remaining community forums:

1 - This list
2 - #openbmc on freenode
3 - Gerrit
4 - github.com/openbmc
5 - community workgroups

Thanks!

-brad
