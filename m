 From what I saw in the design template, librrd to be used to enable any 
daemon to make their data available to collectd.

The proposal here is to externally report the data collected. I 
understood it as; we going to have per plugin D-Bus APIs to report it. 
But looking at it again, I am not sure how is that achieved.

Kun, Do you have a flow schematic ?
