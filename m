The IPMI maintainers will need to comment, but the IPMI spec states "The 
power restore policy determines how the system or chassis behaves when 
AC power returns after an AC power loss."

On our systems, the BMC also loses power on AC loss, so we added the 
ACBoot property to determine if the BMC is booting due to AC loss and 
can apply the power restore policy.

I don't know if ipmid is the right place to determine if the system is 
returning from an AC power loss, but if it could be standardized that 
would be great.
