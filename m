I wrote an experimental iBT device model using a chardev device backend 
to communicate with the external world (the host)

The goal was to connect a Aspeed BMC QEMU machine to a PowerNV QEMU machine 
using an external IPMI BMC. The PowerNV machine uses by default an internal
BMC simulator but it can be switched to an external one and connect to a 
remote BMC using the OpenIPMI's lanserv serial interface.

It operated on top of the iBT device only.
