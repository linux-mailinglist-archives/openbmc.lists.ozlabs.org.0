My homebrew app, which I run like so fake-sensors -c 
"/xyz/openbmc_project/inventory/system/board/AC_Baseboard" --loglevel 1 
--sensors {sensors_cnt} --interval {interval_ms} :)
It's just for tests.

I've come back to the topic and I observe two kind of behaviors:
- mapperx crash (pretty rare)
- error "Error getting associations from ...".

The former still requires debugging, but for the latter I have simple 
explanation - only one application spawns thousands of sensors and is 
bombarding ObjectMapper with InterfaceAdded signals, while receiving 
'Get' on Associations interface (and possibly other calls). I've 
introduced a workaround - up to 3 retries of do_associations() on 
ETIMEDOUT, which allowed mapperx to correctly consume 2000 sensors.

However, performance could be better. On AST2600 listing of 2000 sensors 
by ObjectMapper takes 130s, 60s for 1000. Furthermore - it's just local 
workaround for bigger problem - D-Bus scalability in embedded system.

It looks like sooner or later we need to figure out more lightweight IPC 
for telemetry.

Regards,
Adrian
