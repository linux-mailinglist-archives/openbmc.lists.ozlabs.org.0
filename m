If you are referring to the phosphor-hwmon repository (as opposed to 
dbus-sensors), I would accept a patch
that does that.

There is already a case in phosphor-hwmon where an OperationalStatus 
interface, with a boolean
Functional property, can get added.Â  Another idea would be to set that 
to not Functional in this case,
and have the web UI check that and display something different if it 
isn't functional.

In hindsight, having another property on the Sensor.Value interface to 
give the sensor status, like
working, broken, or not-available may have been a good idea.
