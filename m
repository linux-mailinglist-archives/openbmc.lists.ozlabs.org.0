Using EM in this context would allow a single image to support both a 
multi-host system and single host system. If that's possible I'd think 
that would be better. I guess the question becomes if you have some way 
to dynamically detect a multi-host system, that'd be better. If that's 
not possible, then you might be stuck with a hardcoded file.
