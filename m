That's 7,213,895,789,838,336 possibilities. Let's also say there are 8000 incoming TCP connections to the web server - I know, it's kind of absurd, but let's assume a massively coordinated attack. /8000=901,736,973,729. Multiply that by 2 seconds, and you get roughly 57,187 years to exhaust all possibilities. Granted, it's likely the password would be found in a quarter of that time, but that's still 14,296 years. The problem gets lots worse quickly when the password is longer. Even a 4 character password is 84,934,656 possibilities and 8000 incoming connections it'd still take 5.8 hours to exhaust everything, and by then the system would have lots of other problems with that many attempts. Though it also could be successfully argued that anyone using a 4 character password is asking for it. ðŸ˜‰
Neil, thanks for

Cc: +Ed Tanous for BMCWeb.Â  I created an issue on BMCWeb to track this 
specific approach: https://github.com/openbmc/bmcweb/issues/151

So I would support a design for BMCWeb to have a 2-4 second delay for 
every authentication failure.Â  But I think it comes with problems of its 
own and I don't know if it is the right answer for everyone.

Specifically, as I wrote in the issue/151 this solution gives attackers 
another way to DoS the machine.
Also, what defense does it provide against an attacker who uses many 
multiple connections?Â  Without additional defenses, such an attacker can 
theoretically try 1000 passwords in that 2-4 second time window.Â  To be 
sure this is a more sophisticated attacker and the attack requires more 
system resources.

What is the right way to defend against password-guessing attacks (short 
of going to 100% certificate-based auth)?

- Joseph

Right now they get an "authentication failure" message which leads them to believe their password was wrong, or their account is missing, and that confuses them.Â  My issues with linux-pam and pam_abl are to help provide clarity to the user what happeded to their login attempt.Â  Is this what you want?
