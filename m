Ah, so you still want the device created, but not bound?

That might not work for status = "reserved" then, and I'm not sure we
want to change the semantics for that.

Just so I'm following along correctly: you still need this described in
the DT (rather than instantiating entirely from userspace), because you
need additional platform data for the new device, is that correct?

Cheers,


Jeremy
