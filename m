This is a great proposal, just a few concerns/notes.

There is a REMOVERCS device config file option that can be configured to 
remove an individual sensor or any sensor of the device when a given set 
of return codes occur when attempting to read the sensor.

REMOVERCS combines this error condition to the behavior of removing the 
sensor from Dbus. I'd be interested in how these types of 
bahavior-to-conditions will be mapped within the device's config file.

In the case of phosphor-hwmon, isnt a timeout condition similar to error 
retries since a timeout condition is presented as a ETIMEDOUT return 
code on the sensor.
> - invalid value
This is another area I'd be interested to hear more on, how would one go 
about defining when a value would be invalid? Or is this a simple, 
negative values are invalid for a sensor that should always return a 
positive value?

> "error retries": number of retries before declaring the sensor has an error
This would be great to have configurable per sensors, however a possible 
issue here would be allowing too many retries causing hwmon to take too 
long. So this should be capped or controlled in someway with the delay 
between reads as well. Right now a sensor is allowed to be retried 10x's 
with a 100ms delay between each attempt.
