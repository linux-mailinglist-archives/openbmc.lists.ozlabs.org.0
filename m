Hi Everyone

I have a Google news alert for OpenBMC and this came across today:

https://tachyum.com/pr-2020-06-02.shtml

The article includes a link to our project homepage.  I couldn't find a
CCLA from Tachyum.  Is there anyone out there that can provide some
context I might be missing?

thx - brad
