> We donâ€™t have telemetryservice in BMC currently so are you currently doing it using webui? Or you have written a app using redfish APIs?  I asked similar question in last week work group meeting. I think it will be useful to have ability to add new report definitions.
I have an app that uses the current websocket implementation on openBMC 
and have been reviewing the needs for transitioning the app to redfish 
when the time comes. One limitation of those is not being able to update 
the active subscription without tearing it down and starting it again, 
resulting in a few seconds of missed readings.

Being able to update the content of the subscription on the fly would be 
a huge value add I think.

I query the system again for all the available sensors and see thermal and power readings for the CPUs. I want updates on these every second just like my initial report.
