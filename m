I believe all non-admin users have their default shell set to 
/bin/nologin per code in phosphor user manager:
https://github.com/openbmc/phosphor-user-manager/blob/master/user_mgr.cpp
Search for "nologin".

When reading this code, not only priv-admin users will have the "ssh" 
group role per
https://github.com/openbmc/docs/blob/master/architecture/user-management.md#supported-group-roles
