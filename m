Agreed and this is done in unit tests.

Thanks.

Nobody said that tests results are going to be a blind go/no go. That's 
not the case.

That's a bit harsh statement, considering years of development put into 
the code itself and contributions made by team in other related areas 
(sensors, entity-manager, sdbusplus etc.).

Like Andrew stated - this is an really nasty edge case, a total f-up on 
our side. I believe delay caused by our plain oversight is than how we 
assess changes before merging. I could be running my own instance of 
static analysis tool paid from my pocket for all I care. Does it mean 
it's wrong? We also strive to shorten the timelines but quality comes first.

This is similar to #1 and I don't agree - I've never stated that. You're 
talking to a guy who often debugs _and_ fixes external bug himself while 
root-causing. We're on the same side!

I see your point and understand your concerns. Thanks for pointing out 
clearly your arguments.

I would prefer to not dwell into further discussion here as certain 
topics are far beyond my control. I'll just assure you we're trying to 
do the best we can with resources available. Whenever similar related 
issues or decisions to make arise in the future I will be surely better 
equipped to make informed decisions aligned with general open source 
consensus.

Regards,
Adrian
