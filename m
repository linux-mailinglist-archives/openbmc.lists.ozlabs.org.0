I don't have any first-hand experience, the idea is interesting, but 
looking at the project's docs and issues list, looks like it doesn't 
really support C/C++ [1], so probably it's not going to be useful for 
OpenBMC?

In OpenBMC's project context I think it also overlaps somewhat with that 
cve-check Yocto class we discussed a couple of times on Security WG 
meetings, though if it supported C/C++, I think it could still be useful.
