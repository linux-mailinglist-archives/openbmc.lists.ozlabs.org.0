It could be derived from the bus timeout value by computing 'divide by
x' roughly but it couldn't cover all use cases because this H/W timeout
value would depends on each environment. There are many factors that
can affect it such as bus speed, peer-master's bus driving
characteristic, average transaction period on the bus and so on thus
it may need fine adjustments through a DT setting, I think.

Thanks,
