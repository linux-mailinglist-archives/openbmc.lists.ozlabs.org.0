Hi Troy,

The phosphor-sel-logger will log the IPMI SEL and Redfish event to the 
journal.  Other modules are then responsible for getting the events out 
of the journal and making them available to a user.

For example in Intel systems, we use rsyslog to extract the IPMI SEL log 
entries from the journal and store them to a persisted syslog file. (See 
https://github.com/Intel-BMC/openbmc/tree/intel/meta-openbmc-mods/meta-common/recipes-extended/rsyslog.)

Then, IPMI uses the SEL entries in the syslog file to handle the SEL 
IPMI commands. (See 
https://github.com/openbmc/intel-ipmi-oem/blob/master/src/storagecommands.cpp.)
