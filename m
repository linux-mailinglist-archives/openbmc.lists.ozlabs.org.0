Hello,

Currently, the Linux Aspeed SMC driver computes the decoding ranges of
each CS (AHB memory window on which the flash contents are mapped)
from the size of the detected flash device. It seems that some chips
have issues with the computed ranges and for these, it would be nice
to be able to define custom decoding ranges in the DT.

Here is a little series doing that, including a preliminary fix. Last
patch is a simple test for the AST2500 EVB. Comments welcome.

Thanks,

C.
