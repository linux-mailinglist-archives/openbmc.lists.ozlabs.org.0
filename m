around 30+ traces for each Redfish request.If we enable the bmcweb 
logging, with thatÂ  journal is full of bmcweb traces.

We have different log levels in bmcweb like error, critical, info, 
debug, but what is missing is we don't have some compile time variable 
to control it( currently it is either full or none.)

Yes, I had a different experience in the recent bug where the failure 
was intermittent and it was happening only after running the regression, 
when I look into the log, not a single trace was there.Hence I thought 
that atleast the logs which is being marked as error(BMCWEB_LOG_ERROR) 
should have been written to the journal.

Say In production if we find some issue and we ask for the journal then 
journal will not be useful as it will not be having any traces to debug.

Sure, I would be pushing the patch for the same.
