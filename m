Thanks for the tests

This means that the training failed for all HCLK settings. We never had
an AST2400 board with a second device on the FMC controller but we noticed
that any freq setting above 50MHz was unstable.

Also, aspeed-g4.dtsi does not have any "spi-max-frequency" for flash@1.
This needs an update.

Curious. The device seems alive and very slow.

Could you please add "dyndbg="file drivers/spi/* +p;" to the bootargs
and reboot ?

Since spi0.1 seems to be really slow, could you run

   time mdsum /dev/mtd5

and compare with flash-wedge100.v2021.13.1 ? But please update
"spi-max-frequency" in the DT first.

Thanks,

C.
