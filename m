I assume that removing that patch doesn't fix the issue, it would only
make it worse, right?

It's because increasing that number causes it to poll longer for the
event, the host takes longer than 100us to generate the event, and if
the event is missed the time when it is checked again is very long.

Polling for 100us is already pretty extreme. 200us is really too long.

The real problem is that there is no interrupt for this.  I'd also guess
there is no interrupt on the host side, because that would solve this
problem, too, as it would certainly get around to handling the interupt
in 100us.  I'm assuming the host driver is not the Linux driver, as it
should also handle this in a timely manner, even when polling.

If people want hardware to perform well, they ought to design it and not
expect software to fix all the problems.

The right way to fix this is probably to do the same thing the host side
Linux driver does.  It has a kernel thread that is kicked off to do
this.  Unfortunately, that's more complicated to implement, but it
avoids polling in this location (which causes latency issues on the BMC
side) and lets you poll longer without causing issues.

I'll let the people who maintain that code comment.
