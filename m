Lee,

Thanks for responding.

The tests I am proposing are specifically for OpenBMC firmware features, 
not for its hardware or platform features.Â  So I don't the fwts suite is 
appropriate.

I've been advised before to use CHIPSEC, but my use case is OpenPOWER, 
and I want this work to be accessible to everyone.
I would be okay if someone else to incorporate the checks I want check 
into CHIPSEC, but I don't think I could use the results.
