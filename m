I look forward to seeing you there.

The PLDM/MCTP stack is partially implemented.  Reviews are here: 
https://gerrit.openbmc-project.xyz/q/mctp and work continues.

The email archive is here: https://lists.ozlabs.org/pipermail/openbmc/.  
My understanding of BMC/host interactions is weak, and I apologize if I 
made misstated anything.  With that, I understand OpenBMC intends to use 
Redfish APIs, and IBM is moving from host IPMI to MCTP/PLDM.

Thanks, that would be helpful.  I've added the topic to the agenda, 
here: 
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b7x9BaxsfcukQDqbvZsU2ehMq4xoJRQvLxxsDUWmAOI/. 
   This week's agenda looks pretty big...we'll cover this topic when we 
can.
