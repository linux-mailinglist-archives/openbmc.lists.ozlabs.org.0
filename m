Hi all,

I'm fine with replacing the jsnbd code with a newer implementation,
provided there's general community acceptance for doing so. If that's
the case, I'm happy to use the existing repo, or replacing openbmc/jsnbd
entirely - whatever suits best.

[Perhaps in your design document, you can expand the Alternatives
Considered section, to provide some motivation to change over]

However, I'm *not* OK with just introducing a completely alternate VM
implementation and leaving jsnbd as-is, where some platforms use one,
and some the other. We have way too many instances where there are two
separate implementations and/or repos that deliver the same
functionality. I would like to avoid making that problem worse.

So, either:

 - submit these as updates to jsnbd, which implement the new structure as
   you like. I'd be happy to hand over the repo to the new maintainers.

 or

 - provide the new VM implementation as a new repo, propose to change
   platforms to use the new implementation, and we can delete jsnbd.

Cheers,


Jeremy
