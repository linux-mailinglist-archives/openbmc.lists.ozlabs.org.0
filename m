FWIW, I am interested in moving the OpenBMC project away from having 
root login access enabled by default, and specifically disabling SSH 
access in general, and root access to the BMC's shell.02 I also want to 
have a secure way to re-enable this when needed.02 See 
https://github.com/ibm-openbmc/dev/issues/15280202 Please let me know if 
you have any ideas on this topic.


I had understood the original question in this email thread as a request 
to "disable root access" so "root cannot login".02 (Note that one 
consequence of disabling root login is that once you remove root access, 
it is hard to get back.02 You'll have to use the sudo comand or su 
command from another user account, and I don't think sudo is present on 
OpenBMC systems.)

I understand that deleting the root user is not advisable because the 
system will break.02 Instead the alternative is to disable access to the 
root account, for example, by doing one of:
- Change root's login shell to /sbin/nologin
- Change the root password to empty or lock the root password
- Change Linux-PAM to deny root account access
- Expire the root account (chage -E0 root)

Any idea which approach works best for OpenBMC?
