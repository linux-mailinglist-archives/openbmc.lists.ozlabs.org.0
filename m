Hi James

We have a number of applications we are looking at converting to getting =
their configuration from EM.  Some of the configuration data is quite =
large and may not make sense to put on dbus.

For example=E2=80=A6

On some POWER systems the BMC is responsible for figuring out which =
board it is running on and selecting one of many host firmware =
configurations to present to the host firmware.  We are considering =
using EM to accomplish this.

This is a large, binary data set and one idea to avoid putting it on =
dbus was to just put a path to a file in the EM configuration.  Is this =
a bad idea?

Thanks!
