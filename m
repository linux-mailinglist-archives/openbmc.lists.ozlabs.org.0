I do want to make a distinction between data that describes the
properties of the system (e.g. things you'd find in a schematic) vs data
generated by applications.  My intended audience was the people
generating the former.  Any ideas on what an outline that maintains that
distinction and includes application generated data would look like?

Yeah, this is definitely something I've been wanting to cover.  Any
ideas on how to make this easy for someone to do?  For example we have
the anti-patterns document with a template - if we have a similar best-
practices document with a template would that help?  I'm not so sure
because the anti-patterns document hasn't gotten much traction
unfortunately...
