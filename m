That makes sense to me.Â  I want document stuff for both system 
integrators (who put together firmware images) and system administrators 
(who perform BMC initial configurations, oversee BMC operation, etc.).Â  
We also need a place for documentation for things like how to use 
BMCWeb's mTLS feature which cuts across system integration and 
administration.Â  Details: https://github.com/ibm-openbmc/dev/issues/1531

I would not like to put it into /docs/designs, since this is not exactly design how it will be implemented. This document was meant to guide the OpenBMC users how they can implement BMC health statistics themselves.
