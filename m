Hello,

Thanks for the response on this. Every company seems to have a different 
version scheme and the parsing might not fit into upstream 
implementation of the Get Device ID command.

My proposal is to add major and minor version to the dev_id.json and 
this can be populated in the meta-xxx layer (something like this 
https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/blob/master/meta-ibm/recipes-phosphor/ipmi/phosphor-ipmi-config.bbappend). 
If the format of the VERSION_ID does not match the master tag format, 
then major and minor version will be picked from the dev_id.json. With 
this approach every company can share the upstream implementation of the 
command. Thoughts?

Regards,
Tom
