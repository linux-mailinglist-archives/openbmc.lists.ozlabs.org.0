Vijay is correct in that today the image file is deleted after a 
successful activation. Therefore today's logic will for example delete 
the file from /tmp/images/ after Host1 was updated, and a subsequent 
request to update Host2 would fail because the image file would not 
exist anymore. The reason for deleting the file is to preserve space 
since the file is assumed that it's not needed anymore after it was used 
for activation. Otherwise we can potentially fill up the /tmp space.

Let's say we keep the image files around forever in /tmp/images/, next 
I'm thinking about the Redfish API where the upload and activation is a 
single step, we'd need to figure out how to specify which Host instances 
should be updated.

One thought is to create a property that the user specifies for which 
Host they want to update. This would require creating the 
/xyz/openbmc_project/software/hostX interfaces and the new property when 
the BMC starts up. Then for example:
- User sets the new "this should be updated" property for host1 and 
host3.
- User calls the Redfish API and select the bios image to upload.
- The BMC updater sees it's a host bios image and creates 
hostX/<versionid> interfaces
- THe BMC updater calls the bios_X updater script for only the host 
instances that have the "this should be updated" property set.

It'd also be good if you could check if Redfish has an ability to 
somehow specify the target that needs to be updated, or if others have 
implemented this ability in some other way.
