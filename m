Thanks for pointing that out. It seems like logical path to follow. Do 
you have some pointers to some reviews or discussion? CpuCore as of now 
is empty.

Up to this point we've established, that sensors/metrics would be linked 
to given item by association. That leaves figuring out how to 'glue' 
together Redfish property with given D-Bus entity.

Agreed. I suppose we should forget about 'old ways' and previous meaning 
of IPMI sensor. BTW Redfish specifies such properties as 'metrics'.

What are the limitations of Sensor.Value interface when it comes to 
representing values in ProcessorMetrics and similar schemas?

ProcessorMetrics uses such units for its metrics:
- bytes
- % (already available as 'utilization')
- MHz
- Cel (altready available as 'temperature')
- count (number of events/occurrences)

I suppose that we could just extend namespaces and units of Sensor.Value 
to cover them and call it a day. We would retain compatibility with 
existing sensors code, TelemetryService etc. (I agree with below comment 
by Ed). I am aware, that when more schemas and metric types comes this 
list will grow, but do we have other alternative?

What are your thoughts? If Sensor.Value is not the way, then how would 
we define the next interface?

Yes, this is the gap we still need to address. Perhaps idea with with an 
well defined enum is not a bad one?

Taking an example of ProcessorMetrics\CoreMetrics[]\UnhaltedCycles
We would have an D-Bus sensor with given interfaces:

xyz.openbmc_project.Association.Definitions
.Associations	{"cpucore", "all_sensors", "/xyz.../core/5"}

xyz.openbmc_project.Sensor.Value
.Unit		"Count" # new unit
.Value		123123

xyz.openbmc_project.CpuCore.Metrics # New imagined interface with enum
.Type		"UnhaltedCycles"

Thanks a lot for your input, it seems like we're going in good direction.
