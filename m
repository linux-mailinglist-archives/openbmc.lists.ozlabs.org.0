Hi James

another EM question for you...

Are there any guidelines or best practices on upstreaming EM =
configurations?  Put another way, if I wanted to ensure that you would =
accept my configurations with new types or classes (e.g. Pid, ADC, =
etc..), what would I need to do up front to make that process as smooth =
as it can be?

thx - brad=
