I suspect the problem is that the HW (and yes this would be a HW bug)
doesn't order the CPU -> memory and the CPU -> MMIO path.

What I think happens is that the store to txde0 is potentially still in
a buffer somewhere on its way to memory, gets bypassed by the store to
MMIO, causing the MAC to try to read the descriptor, and getting the
"old" data from memory.

It's ... fishy, but that isn't the first time an Aspeed chip has that
type of bug (there's a similar one in the USB device controler iirc).

Cheers,
Ben.
