Thank you Brad & Andrew, we will address your feedback and update the 
design document accordingly.

Yes. Based on Patrick's concerns - is it still a legal concern if BMC 
works as a mediator to forward the license to the host, without 
processing or installing the license at BMC? Host is not an OpenSource 
code, and any OEMs can do their proprietary implementations as needed.

We are looking forward for the collaboration from the community on this 
feature.

Thank you Brad for your views. Please continue.

If there are any technical concern about this feature, we will work on 
that as per the comments received on the design document. Legal concern 
can be resolved by finding out a way forward together as a community.

Thanks & regards,
Sunitha
