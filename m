I always view D-Bus interface as a specification / API which can work 
with different producers / consumers (correct me, if that's not what we 
intend with D-Bus interface here). Problem with Option 1 is, it will end 
up in having multiple producers exposing different interface, and 
thereby consumers(user interface facing applications) of D-Bus must be 
aware about all the D-Bus interfaces and always requires change.

Consider, we want to expose ChassisType, then irrespective of PLDM FRU / 
IPMI FRU / Proprietary FRU, Consumer applications must read it in the 
same manner. Having different interface / property types, requires 
update in both the end. PLDM FRU / IPMI FRU can be in common form 
(except few nit's /OEM's). We need to make sure it is represented in 
that angle. As of today phosphor-dbus-interfaces doesn't have FRU 
interface, but it has inventory related interfaces (exposed by 
Entity-Manager), which is what Redfish uses (i.e. Indirectly the 
FruDevice exposed interface is hidden by Entity-manager, and inventory 
interface exposed by entity-manager is used).

As of today, entity-manager doesn't add Inventory interface 
automatically for Add-on cards (which doesn't have any json 
configuration), but needs exposure (say PLDM based Add on card devices 
will be of this type), but shouldn't be hard to add it anyway.

Now the question is do we want to expose FRU as a separate interafce to 
be used in User facing application, or shall we just use Inventory based 
interface itself ?If inventory itself can be used, then let's go ahead 
and add more fields to those if missing anything / correct the same 
accordingly.

James, Deepak, Patrick - your thoughts ?


regards,

Richard


Say, we want to expose Manufacturer Name, then it can be produced by 
PLDM FRU application, IPMI Fru based application or even any proprietary 
application and consumed by applications like Redfish / any other 
proprietary one. In this way applications can get the data of what ever 
it is required. I don't find any data which is different in terms of 
PLDM FRU / IPMI FRU (ofcourse OEM fields will be there, but that can't 
be unique), but we need to implement things in common form though.

Say, ChassisType in IPMI FRU is single byte field, whereas in PLDM FRU 
it will be of string. But we need to represent the same in well 
established form (say SMBIOS System /Chassis Type enums). i.e. Producers 
(IPMI FRU must change it from one byte type to enum), and PLDM FRU from 
string to proper enum. Redfish will use this one and accordingly map it 
to the schema

        IBM systems have a requirement to consume FRU information sent
        down via the host firmware and then relay that onto D-Bus (and
        then onto Redfish). The host firmware will send down FRU

        We wanted to use entity manager to enable transforming the PLDM

        xyz.openbmc_project.Inventory.Decorator.Asset interface. I have
        an update to the PLDM design doc to capture this flow [1], and
        some D-Bus interfaces [2] proposed on Gerrit. Would appreciate
        feedback on the same. The high level idea is that the pldm
        daemon will host raw PLDM FRU information on D-Bus, and via JSON

        - I see there is provision for persistence, but it looks like
        applying the persisted information works only if "D-Bus probes"
        succeed. We have a requirement to make the host-sent inventory
        information available even when the host is powered off. Now if
        the host has sent this, then powers off, and then BMC reboots,
        the BMC will no longer have the raw PLDM FRU information on
        D-Bus and hence the entity manager probe on the same will fail.
        Question is, can the probes be made optional when reading the
        persisted config (system.json)?

      I've got some feedback on the proposal above, which is primarily
      directed at/impacts how the PLDM daemon provides FRU information
      to the entity manager daemon. Wanted to discuss the same here.
      <br>
      <br>
      Very briefly, the proposal was :
      <br>
      a) The PLDM daemon will parse PLDM FRU format data and host the
      same on D-Bus as a set of PLDM FRU properties (similar to how the
      FruDevice daemon hosts properties under
      xyz.openbmc_project.FruDevice).
      <br>
      b) Apply EM system/board specific configurations on a) to be able
      to create specific inventory D-Bus objects (this is how EM works
      today).
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      To do a) above, there are 3 options:
      <br>
      <br>
      1) Propose a D-Bus interface in phosphor-dbus-interfaces. This was
      [2] in my original email above. The concern raised by Patrick here
      is that this interface is very specific to a protocol (PLDM in
      this case), whereas the phosphor D-Bus interfaces are mostly
      abstract and protocol agnostic.
      <br>
      <br>
      In my opinion, PLDM is also a data model, so PLDM specific D-Bus
      interfaces can enable two apps that are PLDM aware (for eg a PLDM
      requester app talking to the PLDM daemon) to talk to each other. I
      do see other protocol specific D-Bus interfaces as well (for eg
      related to SMBIOS). So I don't really understand the concern. The
      protocol specific interfaces do not preclude other abstract
      interfaces.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      2) Propose a generic/abstract 'FRU properties' kind of D-Bus
      interface. This is something that both the PLDM daemon and FRU
      device daemon could use to host FRU information on D-Bus, and to
      provide the same as an intermediate FRU format data to apps like
      EM. The suggestion on the docs commit above [2] was to have an
      interface like {Enum[Protocol], array[byte]}. I think instead this
      could be a dict[string, variant[string, int64]], for a FRU
      property to value mapping.
      <br>
      <br>
      While this sounds interesting, are the maintainers of EM and
      FruDevice interested in such an interface? Based on how this
      interface is designed, it might imply changes to FruDevice and
      Entity Manager. I might be interested in chasing this based on the
      feedback received, and if this will really have users other than
      the PLDM daemon.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      3) If everyone thinks option 1 is a bad idea, and if the interest
      in option 2 is limited, I could do this based on how the FruDevice
      daemon and EM interact today, which is based on kind of a private
      D-Bus interface between the two apps. I don't think the Fru device
      daemon is tied up to EM though, it could even be in its own
      repository.
