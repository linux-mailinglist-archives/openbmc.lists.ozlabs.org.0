If the only differences are in features the driver doesn't utilize, I'm 
not clear on how it adds any complexity.  As far as I'm aware, neither 
datasheet is public (NCT7363 nor NCT7362), so if we're going to have a 
public driver for one, why not also do so for the other?  It's a single 
additional line -- and furthermore, having made that change and tested 
it out, I can report that the driver seems to work just fine on NCT7362 
hardware as well.
