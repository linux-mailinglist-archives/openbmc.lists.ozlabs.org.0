Hah - that's what I get for opening my mouth ðŸ¤£.  I wouldn't say I'm 
interested.  I'm not sure why I felt compelled to respond - Maybe I was 
just feeling chatty and wanted to support one of my fellow server OEMs.

Anyhow, I took a quick look and in general the proposal seems lacking in 
details.  References to dbus objects and interfaces need to be filled in 
with details.  "License data" needs to be explained - what is it, in 
terms of Redfish and DBus?  Other vague statements about Redfish need to 
be explained in specific terms of the new schema (resources, actions, 
etc). Interactions between applications need to be spelled out 
explicitly (more dbus interfaces?).  The resulting Redfish data model is 
not apparent to me (I admit I've never looked at the new schema, but I 
do know a thing or two about Redfish so ideally I shouldn't need to?).  
Much like the Redfish concern, the PLDM data model needs to be expanded 
upon and explained in terms of a PLDM specification.

>More broadly, setting aside Patrick's legal concerns,

And they do seem like reasonable concerns, but I am not a lawyer.  I 
don't think engineers are going to be able to allay those concerns.

Isn't this self-evident from the schema being adopted by the DMTF?

How many parties collaborated on getting FSI into Linux?   How many 
parties are collaborating on <foocorp>-misc or <platform>-misc?  Are 
those different somehow?

I'm sure it probably sounds like I'm advocating for this feature.  I'm 
really not.  I'm trying to generally improve my understanding of what 
types of code submissions are welcome and what kinds are not through 
questions.  Maybe I just need to stop looking for patterns where none 
exist...
