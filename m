Thanks Brad for putting this together.

Even further, /etc is mounted as an overlayfs that has its own 
restrictions on renaming/deleting files 
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OverlayFS). The overlay is either mounted 
over / or /etc depending if you want to preserve the rest of the 
filesystem as read-only.

The cereal package can be used to store data and supports versioning for 
when changes are desired. Multiple apps already use it in OpenBMC.
