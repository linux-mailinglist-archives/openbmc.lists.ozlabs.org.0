Hi Brad,

Yep, sounds like we should find a better approach.

We want to ensure that any of those paths use persistent kernel
naming/numbering though. In your example, we would need that i2c bus to
be guaranteed to be probed as i2c bus id 2.

There are facilities in place to ensure this happens, and as far as I
know we are currently using those, but we will need to ensure that stays
the case.

Would this be specific to each bus type? The example for i2c is good, as
we do have a mechanism for persistent device paths under /sys/bus/i2c/,
but the same is not true for other bus types (eg, /sys/bus/platform). To
handle that, we may want the paths to be of the form:

 /usr/share/phosphor-hwmon/<bus>/<bus-specific-id>.conf

Where <bus> is from a predefined set of supported bus types, and
<bus-specific-id> depends on that; it would typically be the name under
/sys/bus/<bus>/devices, but we may want to introduce custom mappings
perhaps?

Cheers,


Jeremy
